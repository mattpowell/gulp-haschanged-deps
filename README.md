# gulp-haschanged-deps
> Comparator function for `gulp-changed` to determine if any of the dependencies for a js module has changed. Currently supports CommonJS and ES6 modules.

TODO:
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add more/better documentation and examples
- [ ] Provide options to throw on parser error and to cache flattened deps (if we decide to keep that).
- [ ] Potentially support aliased `require`s in CommonJS modules
- [ ] Potentially support AMD?
